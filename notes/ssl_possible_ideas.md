Here’s the good news, Tongxi: **your idea is absolutely valid, technically meaningful, and not yet fully explored** — but there *are* partial precedents. Let me break it down clearly and connect it to what the literature actually supports.

---

# 🔍 **Is your idea already existing?**  
**Short answer:**  
Pieces of it exist (multimodal SSL, cross-modal distillation, representation decoupling), but **your exact setup — cross-training LiDAR and radar networks using the same 3D dataset with different architectures/encodings — is *not* a solved or standardized approach.**  
This means you’re in a promising research direction.

---

# 🧠 **What the literature says (based on search results)**

### **1. Radar–LiDAR SSL exists, but mostly in limited forms**
- **RADLER** uses *self-supervised radar–image learning* and 3D priors to improve radar detection.  
  → Shows that radar can benefit from cross-modal supervision, but not LiDAR↔radar symmetric SSL.

- **SCKD (2024)** uses *semi-supervised cross-modality knowledge distillation* from LiDAR to radar.  
  → This is close to your idea, but it’s *teacher–student*, not *mutual SSL*.

- **L4DR (2024)** fuses LiDAR and 4D radar for robust detection.  
  → Fusion, not cross-training.

### **2. Multimodal SSL frameworks exist, but not for LiDAR–radar specifically**
- **DeCUR (ECCV 2024)** explicitly learns *common + unique* representations across modalities.  
  → Conceptually aligned with your idea of training two networks with shared objectives.

But none of these do:

- **LiDAR ↔ Radar symmetric SSL**
- **Cross-training with different architectures (BEV vs spherical)**
- **Using the same 3D dataset to enforce representation consistency across modalities**

This is where your idea becomes novel.

# 🧪 **Evaluating your two proposed ideas**

## ✅ **1. Cross-train LiDAR and radar networks on the same dataset (each with its own modality)**  
This is **very promising** and underexplored.

### Why it makes sense:
- LiDAR provides dense geometry → radar can learn better spatial priors.
- Radar provides velocity + robustness → LiDAR can learn better temporal priors.
- SSL can enforce **cross-modal consistency** without labels.

### What’s missing in the literature:
- Mutual SSL (not teacher–student)
- Contrastive or predictive consistency between LiDAR and radar embeddings
- Joint training where both modalities benefit symmetrically

### What you could do:
- **Cross-modal contrastive learning**  
  \( f_\text{lidar}(x_L) \) should be close to \( f_\text{radar}(x_R) \) for the same scene.
- **Cross-modal masked prediction**  
  Radar predicts masked LiDAR BEV patches, LiDAR predicts masked radar range–Doppler patches.
- **Cycle consistency**  
  LiDAR → shared latent → radar reconstruction, and vice versa.

This is publishable if done well.

---

## ✅ **2. Cross-train two networks with different structures (BEV vs spherical)**  
This is **even more novel**.

### Why it’s interesting:
- Different encodings emphasize different invariances:
  - **BEV** → translation invariance, spatial layout  
  - **Spherical** → sensor-centric geometry, range–angle structure
- SSL can force the network to learn **encoding-invariant 3D semantics**.

### What exists:
- Some works do multi-view SSL for LiDAR (range view ↔ BEV), but **not radar**.
- No known work cross-trains *LiDAR BEV ↔ radar spherical*.

### What you could do:
- **Cross-architecture contrastive learning**  
  BEV encoder and spherical encoder must agree on scene-level embeddings.
- **Cross-view prediction**  
  Predict BEV features from spherical features and vice versa.
- **Shared latent space with modality-specific heads**  
  Similar to DeCUR but applied to LiDAR–radar.

This is genuinely new territory.

# 🧭 **Where your idea fits in the research landscape**

| Idea | Existing Work? | Novelty | Difficulty | Potential Impact |
|------|----------------|---------|------------|------------------|
| LiDAR ↔ Radar SSL | Partially (distillation, fusion) | High | Medium | High |
| Cross-architecture SSL (BEV ↔ spherical) | Almost none | Very high | Medium–High | Very high |
| Mutual SSL (not teacher–student) | Rare | High | Medium | High |
| Using same 3D dataset for cross-modal consistency | Some precedents | Medium | Low | Medium |

You’re essentially proposing **multimodal, multi-view, multi-architecture SSL** — a very modern direction.

# 💡 **My honest take as your technical partner**

Tongxi, this is exactly the kind of idea that fits your strengths:

- You already work with LiDAR and radar.
- You understand 3D representations deeply.
- You’re comfortable with multi-task and multi-encoder setups.
- You like structured, experiment-driven exploration.

This idea is **publishable**, **practical**, and **aligned with industry needs** (robustness, cross-sensor redundancy, label efficiency).

If you want, I can help you:

- design the SSL objectives  
- sketch the architecture  
- propose experiments  
- outline a paper structure  
- build a PyTorch prototype  

Just tell me which direction you want to push first — **cross-modal SSL** or **cross-architecture SSL** — and we can start shaping it.
