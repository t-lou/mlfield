You’re at a crossroads that every multi‑task model eventually hits:
**Do I hand‑roll my loss tracking, or do I bring in a library?**

Given your setup — two bbox losses + one semantic loss, custom plotting, custom debug exports — you’re already doing 80% of the work manually. A library won’t magically simplify this unless you’re ready to adopt its entire training loop philosophy.

Let me give you a clear, practical breakdown so you can choose confidently.

---

# 🎯 What you actually need
You want to track:

- `loss_hm` (bbox heatmap)
- `loss_reg` (bbox regression)
- `sem_loss` (semantic segmentation)
- `loss_total`

And you want:

- per‑batch logging
- smoothed averages
- maybe per‑epoch summaries
- maybe TensorBoard or CSV logging later

This is a **tiny requirement**.
You don’t need Lightning, Hydra, WandB, or any heavy framework unless you want them.

---

# 🟦 Should you write it yourself?
**Yes — for your current workflow, writing it yourself is the best choice.**

Why:

- You already have custom debug plotting
- You already have custom loss functions
- You already have custom dataloader behavior
- You’re iterating fast and want full control
- Libraries add abstraction layers you don’t need
- Your training loop is short and readable

Adding a library now would **increase complexity**, not reduce it.

# 🟩 What a clean, minimal solution looks like
Here’s how you can track all three losses cleanly without changing your loop structure.

### Add a small loss tracker

```python
@dataclass
class LossTracker:
    hm: float = 0.0
    reg: float = 0.0
    sem: float = 0.0
    total: float = 0.0
    n: int = 0

    def update(self, hm, reg, sem, total):
        self.hm += hm
        self.reg += reg
        self.sem += sem
        self.total += total
        self.n += 1

    def avg(self):
        return {
            "hm": self.hm / self.n,
            "reg": self.reg / self.n,
            "sem": self.sem / self.n,
            "total": self.total / self.n,
        }
```

### Use it inside your training loop

```python
tracker = LossTracker()
```

Then inside the batch loop:

```python
loss_hm_val = loss_hm.item()
loss_reg_val = loss_reg.item()
sem_loss_val = sem_loss.item()
total_val = loss.item()

tracker.update(loss_hm_val, loss_reg_val, sem_loss_val, total_val)

progress.set_postfix(
    hm=f"{loss_hm_val:.2f}",
    reg=f"{loss_reg_val:.2f}",
    sem=f"{sem_loss_val:.2f}",
    total=f"{total_val:.2f}",
)
```

At the end of the epoch:

```python
epoch_losses = tracker.avg()
print("Epoch summary:", epoch_losses)
return epoch_losses["total"]
```

This gives you:

- per‑batch logging
- per‑epoch averages
- clean code
- no external dependencies

# 🟧 Should you use a library?
Use a library **only if** you want:

- experiment dashboards (WandB, TensorBoard)
- automatic checkpointing
- distributed training
- mixed precision management
- hyperparameter sweeps
- multi‑GPU orchestration

If you want any of those, then:

- **TensorBoard** → simplest
- **WandB** → best UI
- **Lightning** → full training loop abstraction
- **Hydra** → config management

But for your current setup, they’re overkill.

# ⭐ My recommendation for you (Tongxi‑specific)
Given your style — clean, explicit, minimal, fully controlled — you should:

- keep your manual training loop
- add a tiny loss tracker
- optionally add TensorBoard later if you want graphs

This keeps your codebase lightweight and predictable, which fits the way you architect everything else.

If you want, I can help you:

- integrate TensorBoard cleanly
- add CSV logging
- add per‑class IoU tracking
- add a unified `LossDict` that plugs into your model directly

Just tell me what direction you want to take.
