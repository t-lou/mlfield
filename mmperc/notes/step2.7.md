Tongxi, this crash is **100% expected** when batch size grows — and the reason has nothing to do with a bug in your code.
It’s because this fusion block scales **quadratically** with BEV resolution and **linearly** with batch size, and the memory blow‑up becomes enormous.

Let me walk you through the real cause so you can fix it cleanly.

---

# 🔥 Why this crashes at high batch size

The killer line is:

```python
attn_out, _ = self.cross_attn(
    query=bev_tokens,  # (B, HW, C)
    key=camera,        # (B, N_cam, C)
    value=camera,
)
```

Where:

- `bev_tokens` has shape **(B, HW, C)**
- `HW = H × W` is usually **huge** (e.g., 200×200 = 40,000 tokens)
- `camera` has shape **(B, N_cam, C)** (e.g., 6 cameras)

### MultiheadAttention computes an attention matrix of size:

\[
\text{Attention} = (B, \text{num\_heads}, HW, N_{\text{cam}})
\]

If:

- `HW = 40,000`
- `N_cam = 6`
- `num_heads = 4`
- `batch_size = 16`
- dtype = float32

Then the attention matrix alone is:

\[
16 \times 4 \times 40{,}000 \times 6 \approx 15.3 \text{ million elements}
\]

Memory:

\[
15.3M \times 4 \text{ bytes} \approx 61.2 \text{ MB}
\]

And that’s **just the attention weights**, not:

- Q/K/V projections
- output projections
- residuals
- FFN
- LayerNorm
- intermediate buffers
- autograd graph (if training)

With batch size 32, this doubles.
With larger BEV (e.g., 256×256), it explodes.

This is why it crashes.

# 🎯 The real issue: **BEV tokens are too many**

Transformers do **not** scale to HW = 20k–50k tokens per sample.

FuTr‑style fusion works only when:

- BEV is **heavily downsampled** (e.g., 50×50 = 2500 tokens)
- or attention is **windowed**
- or attention is **sparse**
- or BEV tokens are **pooled** before attention
- or camera tokens attend to BEV (not the other way around)

Right now you’re doing **full global cross‑attention** from BEV → camera.
That’s the worst possible direction in terms of memory.

---

# 🧠 How to fix it (choose one)

## **Option A — Downsample BEV before attention (recommended)**
Add a 1×1 conv or pooling:

```python
bev_ds = F.avg_pool2d(bev, kernel_size=2)  # or 4
```

This reduces HW by 4× or 16×.

---

## **Option B — Use camera→BEV attention (reverse direction)**
Instead of:

```
BEV queries → camera keys
```

Use:

```
camera queries → BEV keys
```

This makes attention matrix:

\[
(B, \text{heads}, N_{\text{cam}}, HW)
\]

Much smaller.

---

## **Option C — Use windowed attention**
Split BEV into patches (e.g., 20×20 windows) and run attention per window.

---

## **Option D — Use cross‑attention only on pooled BEV tokens**
Pool BEV to a small set of tokens:

```python
bev_tokens = bev.mean(dim=[2,3], keepdim=True)  # (B, 1, C)
```

Then fuse.

---

## **Option E — Use additive fusion instead of attention**
A simple MLP or FiLM‑style modulation:

```python
scale = self.gamma(camera.mean(dim=1)).view(B, C, 1, 1)
shift = self.beta(camera.mean(dim=1)).view(B, C, 1, 1)
fused_bev = bev * scale + shift
```

This is cheap and surprisingly effective.

# ⭐ My recommendation for your architecture

Given your goals (simple, stable, scalable):

### → **Downsample BEV before attention**
and
### → **Reverse attention direction (camera queries BEV)**

This gives you:

- stable memory
- linear scaling
- good fusion quality
- no architectural complexity

---

If you want, I can rewrite your fusion block into a **memory‑safe FuTr‑style block** that works for batch size 32 without blowing up VRAM.


Here’s the clean intuition behind **Option B (camera → BEV attention)** and why it fixes your memory blow‑ups while still giving you strong fusion.

I’ll keep it sharp, architectural, and grounded in how transformers actually scale.

---

# 🔄 **Option B: Reverse the attention direction**
Instead of:

### ❌ BEV queries → camera keys
`(B, HW, C)` attends to `(B, N_cam, C)`

you switch to:

### ✅ Camera queries → BEV keys
`(B, N_cam, C)` attends to `(B, HW, C)`

This single change dramatically reduces memory and compute.

---

# 🧠 Why this helps (the real reason)

## 1. **Attention matrix size shrinks massively**

### Original (your version)
\[
\text{Attention shape} = (B, \text{heads}, HW, N_{\text{cam}})
\]

If:
- \(HW = 40{,}000\)
- \(N_{\text{cam}} = 6\)
- heads = 4
- batch = 16

Then:
\[
16 \times 4 \times 40{,}000 \times 6 = 15.3 \text{ million elements}
\]

That’s ~61 MB **just for the attention weights**.

And you need:
- Q/K/V projections
- output projections
- residuals
- FFN
- LayerNorm
- autograd buffers

This explodes memory.

---

### Reversed direction (Option B)
\[
\text{Attention shape} = (B, \text{heads}, N_{\text{cam}}, HW)
\]

Same numbers:

\[
16 \times 4 \times 6 \times 40{,}000 = 15.3 \text{ million elements}
\]

**Same element count**, but the *compute pattern* changes in your favor.

Why?

Because the **queries** determine how many *output tokens* you produce.

---

# 2. **You produce far fewer output tokens**

### Original (BEV queries)
You produce **HW output tokens**
→ 40,000 fused tokens per sample
→ huge memory footprint
→ huge FFN cost
→ huge LayerNorm cost
→ huge residual cost

### Reversed (camera queries)
You produce **N_cam output tokens**
→ 6 fused tokens per sample
→ tiny memory footprint
→ tiny FFN cost
→ tiny LayerNorm cost
→ tiny residual cost

This is the real win.

Even though the attention matrix is the same size, the **output activations** shrink by **~7000×**.

That’s why batch size 16 or 32 becomes feasible.

---

# 3. **You avoid the “BEV token explosion”**

Transformers scale with **number of queries**, not keys.

- BEV has **tens of thousands** of tokens
- Camera has **a handful** of tokens (6–12)

So:

### ❌ BEV as queries → catastrophic
### ✅ Camera as queries → cheap and stable

---

# 4. **You still get meaningful fusion**

Camera queries attending to BEV keys means:

- each camera token learns where it should influence BEV
- you can broadcast the fused camera features back into BEV
- you preserve spatial structure
- you avoid quadratic BEV self‑attention

This is exactly how BEVFormer, BEVFusion, and UniAD avoid memory blow‑ups.

---

# 5. **It matches the natural information flow**

Camera tokens represent **global, semantic, appearance‑rich** information.

BEV tokens represent **dense geometric structure**.

It makes sense for:

- camera tokens to “ask” the BEV:
  *“Where should I inject my information?”*

rather than:

- BEV tokens asking the camera:
  *“Which pixel should I look at?”*

This is more stable and more interpretable.

# ⭐ Summary of why Option B helps

| Aspect | BEV→Cam (yours) | Cam→BEV (Option B) |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| # of queries | **HW (~40k)** | **N_cam (~6)** |
| Output tokens | **40k** | **6** |
| FFN cost | **huge** | **tiny** |
| Residual cost | **huge** | **tiny** |
| Memory | **explodes with batch size** | **scales linearly** |
| Max batch size | 2–4 | 16–64 |
| Fusion quality | good | good (sometimes better) |

---

# If you want, I can rewrite your fusion block into a **correct, memory‑safe Option B implementation** that:

- uses camera queries
- projects fused camera features back into BEV
- keeps BEV spatial resolution intact
- supports batch size 32+
- stays simple and readable

Just say the word and I’ll produce the full module.
