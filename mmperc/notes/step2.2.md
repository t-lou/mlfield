When you scale from **1 LiDAR + 1 camera** to **multi‑LiDAR + multi‑camera**, there *are* best practices — and the industry has converged on a few clean patterns. The right choice depends on how much flexibility you want and how heavy your fusion block is.

Let me give you the landscape clearly and concisely.

# 🧭 The two options you listed — and which one is better

## **Option 1 — One entry per sensor (recommended)**  
You keep each sensor separate in the dataloader and pass them individually:

```
points = [lidar0, lidar1, lidar2]
images = [cam0, cam1, cam2, cam3, cam4, cam5]
```

Then inside the model:

- Each LiDAR goes through its own encoder  
- Each camera goes through its own encoder  
- You fuse the resulting features/tokens

This is the **cleanest, most scalable, and most flexible** design.

### Why this is the best practice
- Works for any number of sensors  
- Lets you drop sensors at runtime  
- Lets you weight sensors differently  
- Lets you add/remove sensors without rewriting encoders  
- Matches how real autonomous stacks are built (Waymo, Argo, Zoox, Tesla, etc.)

---

## **Option 2 — Merge sensors inside the encoder**  
You concatenate all LiDARs or all cameras before encoding.

Examples:

- Merge LiDARs → one big point cloud  
- Merge cameras → stack images or concatenate tokens

### Why this is *not* ideal
- You lose sensor identity  
- Harder to debug  
- Harder to mask missing sensors  
- Harder to add/remove sensors  
- Camera intrinsics/extrinsics differ → cannot merge raw images  
- LiDARs have different poses → merging raw points is possible but messy

This approach only works cleanly for **multi‑LiDAR**, and even then, most teams prefer per‑sensor encoders.

# 🧱 What real systems do (industry standard)

### **LiDAR**
- Each LiDAR → voxelization → pillar encoder  
- Produce **one BEV per LiDAR**  
- Fuse BEVs (sum, concat, attention, or learned weights)

### **Camera**
- Each camera → CNN/ViT → tokens  
- Fuse tokens using cross‑attention or transformer blocks  
- Optionally lift tokens into BEV (BEVFormer, LSS, etc.)

### **Fusion**
- BEV fusion + camera token fusion  
- Or unified transformer fusion (your FuTr block fits perfectly here)

# 🧩 The cleanest architecture for your project

### **Dataloader**
```
points: List[Tensor]   # one per LiDAR
images: List[Tensor]   # one per camera
```

### **Model**
```python
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_lidars, num_cameras, ...):
        self.lidar_encoders = nn.ModuleList([PointPillarBEV() for _ in range(num_lidars)])
        self.cam_encoders   = nn.ModuleList([TinyCameraEncoder() for _ in range(num_cameras)])
        self.fusion = FuTrFusionBlock()
```

### **Forward**
```python
lidar_bevs = [enc(pc) for enc, pc in zip(self.lidar_encoders, points)]
cam_tokens = [enc(img) for enc, img in zip(self.cam_encoders, images)]

# fuse LiDAR BEVs (sum, concat, or attention)
bev_lidar = fuse_lidar_bevs(lidar_bevs)

# fuse camera tokens
tokens = torch.cat(cam_tokens, dim=1)

# cross-modal fusion
bev_fused = self.fusion(bev_lidar, tokens)
```

This gives you:

- unlimited sensors  
- clean modularity  
- easy debugging  
- easy ablation (LiDAR‑only, camera‑only, both)  
- future‑proof design

# 🏁 Final recommendation

### ✔ **Use one entry per sensor**  
This is the best practice and the most flexible design.

### ✔ **Encode each sensor independently**  
LiDAR → BEV  
Camera → tokens

### ✔ **Fuse after encoding**  
Not before.

### ✘ **Do NOT merge raw sensor data inside the encoder**  
It breaks calibration, flexibility, and modularity.

If you want, I can help you:

- write a clean multi‑sensor dataloader  
- extend your model to `num_lidars` and `num_cameras`  
- design a LiDAR‑fusion module  
- design a camera‑token fusion module  
- make the whole model modality‑configurable (LiDAR‑only, camera‑only, both)

Just tell me how far you want to take it.
