Switching your LiDAR point cloud and BEV features from **float32 → float16** is absolutely possible, and many modern perception stacks do it — but the impact depends on *where* you apply FP16 and *how sensitive your pipeline is to precision loss*. Let’s break it down in a way that’s directly relevant to your BEV ranges and your model architecture.

---

# 🚗 1. Does FP16 make sense for LiDAR point clouds?

### **Yes — for most ADAS BEV pipelines, FP16 is safe for LiDAR coordinates.**

Your coordinate ranges are:

- **X:** 0 → 120 m  
- **Y:** –60 → 60 m  
- **Z:** –5 → 3 m  

FP16 has:

- ~3 decimal digits of precision  
- dynamic range up to ~65,504  
- resolution around **1–2 cm** in the 0–120 m range

### **Precision check**
FP16 step size at magnitude 100 is roughly:

```
epsilon ≈ 0.001 * value ≈ 0.1 m
```

But that’s the *relative* precision. The *absolute* quantization error is typically:

- **1–2 cm** for values < 100  
- **3–5 cm** for values around 120  

For BEV detection, this is totally acceptable because:

- BEV grid resolution is usually **0.2–0.5 m**  
- Gaussian heatmaps blur centers anyway  
- Regression offsets are learned, not directly from raw coordinates  
- LiDAR noise itself is often > 2 cm  

So FP16 precision is *not* the bottleneck.

### **Conclusion for point clouds**
✔ Safe  
✔ Common in production  
✔ Saves memory & bandwidth  
✔ No meaningful accuracy drop

# 🧠 2. Does FP16 make sense for BEV feature maps?

### **Yes — with autocast / mixed precision.**

BEV features (C×H×W) are typically:

- 64–256 channels  
- 200×200 or 300×300 resolution  
- dominated by convolutional ops  

These layers are **highly FP16‑friendly**:

- Tensor Cores accelerate FP16 massively  
- Convolutions are stable in FP16  
- BatchNorm is automatically kept in FP32  
- Attention layers (if any) also work well in FP16  

### **Impact**
- **Speed:** 1.5×–2.5× faster  
- **Memory:** ~50% reduction  
- **Accuracy:** usually unchanged (<0.5% mAP difference)

This is why all modern BEV models (BEVFusion, BEVDet, CenterPoint, TransFusion) train in **mixed precision**.

# ⚠️ 3. Where FP16 can be dangerous

### **A. Raw geometric transforms**
If you do:

- world→camera  
- camera→image  
- LiDAR→BEV projection  
- frustum lifting  
- voxelization  

These steps involve matrix multiplications and divisions. FP16 can introduce:

- jitter  
- rounding errors  
- unstable depth ordering  

**Recommendation:**  
Keep geometric transforms in **float32**, then cast to FP16 afterward.

---

### **B. Very small values (e.g., 1e‑6)**
FP16 underflows easily.  
If you normalize features aggressively, FP16 may zero them out.

---

### **C. Loss computation**
Losses should stay in FP32:

- heatmap focal loss  
- regression L1 loss  
- semantic CE loss  

This is handled automatically by PyTorch AMP.

---

# 🧪 4. Recommended precision strategy for your pipeline

### **1. Load LiDAR in FP32 → cast to FP16**
```python
points = points.astype(np.float16)
```

### **2. Keep transforms in FP32**
```python
points = points_fp32
points_bev = project(points).half()
```

### **3. Run the model in mixed precision**
```python
with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
    out = model(points, images)
```

### **4. Keep losses in FP32**
PyTorch AMP handles this automatically.

# 🟢 5. Final verdict

### **Point cloud in FP16?**  
Yes — safe and efficient.

### **BEV features in FP16?**  
Yes — recommended for speed and memory.

### **Transforms & losses in FP32?**  
Yes — keep them stable.

### **Overall impact**  
- **Memory:** ~50% reduction  
- **Speed:** 1.5–2.5× faster  
- **Accuracy:** almost unchanged  
- **Stability:** good with AMP

If you want, I can help you:

- add AMP to your training loop  
- profile FP16 vs FP32 memory usage  
- check your BEV projection code for FP16 safety  
- convert your NPZ pipeline to store FP16 efficiently  

Just tell me what direction you want to explore.


You’re thinking in exactly the right direction. Let’s break this into two parts:

---

# 🧩 1. Should **gt_boxes** also be float16?

### **Short answer:**  
**Yes, you *can* store gt_boxes in float16 — but you should convert them back to float32 before computing the loss.**

### Why?

- Ground‑truth boxes are **small tensors** (e.g., 200 × 7).  
- They don’t dominate memory or compute.  
- Loss functions (L1, smooth‑L1, IoU, etc.) are **more stable in float32**.  
- FP16 can introduce quantization noise in yaw, width, length, offsets.

### Recommended approach:

- **Store** gt_boxes in FP16 in your NPZ (saves disk + RAM).  
- **Convert to FP32** inside the training loop before loss computation.

Example:

```python
gt_boxes = batch["gt_boxes"].float()  # convert to FP32
```

This is the standard practice in mixed‑precision training.

# 🧩 2. How to ensure the model runs in float16?

You don’t manually convert every tensor.  
You let **PyTorch AMP (autocast)** handle it.

### The correct pattern:

```python
scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()

for batch in loader:
    points = batch["points"].half()      # optional
    images = batch["images"].half()      # optional
    gt_boxes = batch["gt_boxes"].float() # keep FP32 for loss

    with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
        out = model(points, images)
        loss = compute_loss(out, gt_boxes)

    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    scaler.step(optimizer)
    scaler.update()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

### What AMP does automatically:

- **Convolutions → FP16**  
- **Linear layers → FP16**  
- **Attention → FP16**  
- **BatchNorm → FP32**  
- **Loss → FP32**  
- **Gradients → FP16/FP32 mixed**  

This gives you:

- 1.5–2.5× speedup  
- 40–50% memory reduction  
- No accuracy loss  

---

# 🧠 3. Should the model weights be float16?

### **No — keep model weights in FP32.**

AMP automatically casts them to FP16 *during forward*, but the master copy stays FP32.

This avoids:

- gradient underflow  
- weight update instability  
- catastrophic precision loss  

You don’t need to do anything special — AMP handles it.

---

# 🧩 4. Should the BEV features be float16?

Yes — this is where FP16 gives the biggest win.

Your BEV tensor:

```
(B, C, H_bev, W_bev)
```

is large, and FP16:

- halves memory  
- doubles throughput  
- works perfectly with convolutions  

AMP will cast these automatically.

---

# 🟢 5. Summary (the safe recipe)

### **Store in NPZ**
- points → float16  
- camera → uint8  
- semantics → uint8  
- gt_boxes → float16  

### **During training**
- points → `.half()`  
- images → `.half()`  
- gt_boxes → `.float()`  
- model → FP32 weights  
- forward pass → AMP autocast  
- loss → FP32  
- backward → GradScaler  

This is the exact setup used in modern BEV models (BEVFusion, BEVDet, CenterPoint, TransFusion).

If you want, I can help you:

- modify your converter to save gt_boxes as float16  
- add AMP to your training loop  
- profile FP16 vs FP32 memory usage  
- check your BEV projection code for FP16 safety
