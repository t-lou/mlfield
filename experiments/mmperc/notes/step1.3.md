You’ve built the voxelizer → BEV backbone → FuTr‑style fusion block.
That’s exactly the right moment to introduce **multi‑task heads**, because the fused BEV feature map is now a clean, unified representation that can feed multiple tasks in parallel.

Let me show you how to recognize that you’ve reached this stage, and then outline the cleanest multi‑task head layout for your architecture.

# 🧭 How to know you’ve reached the “multi‑task head” stage

You’re ready for multi‑task heads when:

### **1. You have a stable BEV representation**
You now have:

- voxelizer → PFN → BEV backbone → BEV feature map
- optional FuTr fusion → fused BEV map

This gives you a tensor shaped like:

```
(B, C, H, W)
```

This is the canonical input for all downstream tasks.

### **2. Your BEV features are modality‑fused**
FuTr‑style fusion means:

- LiDAR → BEV tokens
- Camera → image tokens
- Cross‑attention → fused BEV

Once fusion is in place, you no longer need to modify the backbone for each task.

### **3. You can freeze the representation**
The BEV feature map is now a **shared representation**.
This is the exact point where multi‑task learning becomes natural.

### **4. You can branch into multiple heads**
Each task now becomes a small, independent module:

- 3D detection
- Drivable area segmentation
- Depth
- Occupancy
- Motion
- Lane segmentation
- Traffic light state

You don’t need to modify the backbone anymore.

# 🧱 The clean multi‑task head layout (recommended)

Your architecture now looks like this:

```
Raw LiDAR
    ↓
Voxelizer (PointPillars-lite)
    ↓
PFN
    ↓
BEV Backbone (Tiny BEV CNN)
    ↓
FuTr Fusion Block (optional camera tokens)
    ↓
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Shared BEV Feature Map  (B, C, H, W)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
    ↓                 ↓
3D Detection Head     Drivable Area Head
    ↓                 ↓
Boxes, scores         Segmentation mask
```

This is the standard layout used in:

- BEVFormer
- UniAD
- BEVFusion
- VAD
- CenterPoint‑based multi‑task models

# 🧩 What the heads look like

### **1. 3D Detection Head (BEV → boxes)**
Usually a CenterNet‑style head:

- heatmap head
- size head
- height head
- rotation head
- velocity head (optional)

All are small 1×1 convs.

### **2. Drivable Area Segmentation Head (BEV → mask)**
A simple segmentation head:

- 3×3 conv
- 1×1 conv
- upsample to BEV resolution
- sigmoid or softmax

This is extremely lightweight.

# 🧠 Why this is the right moment

You’ve already built:

- **representation learning** (voxelizer + backbone)
- **fusion** (FuTr block)

The next step is **task‑specific prediction**, which is exactly what multi‑task heads do.

You don’t need to modify the backbone anymore.
You don’t need to modify the fusion block anymore.
You simply attach heads.

This is the cleanest, most modular stage of the pipeline.

# 🛠️ If you want, I can now generate:

### ✔️ A tiny 3D detection head
CenterPoint‑style, BEV‑native, RTX‑2050‑friendly.

### ✔️ A drivable‑area segmentation head
Lightweight, upsampling, clean.

### ✔️ A unified `MultiTaskHead` module
That wraps both heads and returns a dict:

```python
{
    "detection": {...},
    "drivable_area": mask
}
```

### ✔️ Tests for the multi‑task heads
Shape, gradient, determinism, device consistency.

Just tell me which head you want to implement first.
