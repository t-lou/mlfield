Starting with LiDAR is a smart move — it gives you a clean, well‑structured pipeline before you deal with camera intrinsics, distortion, and multi‑view geometry. And yes, your intuition is correct: **for a FuTr‑style or AdapterFusion‑style architecture, you still need a LiDAR encoder first**, because transformers operate on *features*, not raw point clouds.

Let’s build this step by step so you have a crystal‑clear mental model.

# 🧱 The LiDAR pipeline you need (for multi‑task + transformer fusion)

A minimal but modern LiDAR pipeline has **four stages**:

## 1) **Voxelizer / Pillarization**
This converts raw points \((x, y, z, i)\) into a structured grid.

Two common options:

### **A. PointPillars‑lite (recommended for your RTX 2050)**
- Only discretizes **x–y** plane
- Keeps vertical dimension collapsed
- Produces “pillars” instead of full 3D voxels
- Very fast and light
- Works well for 3D detection + BEV tasks
- Easy to integrate with transformers later

### **B. Full 3D voxelization (spconv / Minkowski)**
- More accurate
- More expensive
- Harder to run on small GPUs
- Not ideal for your first prototype

**For your setup: PointPillars‑lite is perfect.**

---

## 2) **Pillar Feature Network (PFN)**
This takes each pillar and produces a fixed‑size feature vector.

Typical steps:

- Normalize point coordinates
- Compute offsets (to pillar center, to mean, etc.)
- Apply a small MLP
- Max‑pool across points in each pillar

Output:
A tensor shaped like \((H, W, C)\) — a BEV feature map.

This is your **LiDAR backbone input**.

---

## 3) **LiDAR Backbone (BEV CNN or BEV Transformer)**
This is where you extract spatial features.

Two options:

### **A. CNN backbone (classic PointPillars)**
- 2D CNN over BEV
- Very fast
- Easy to scale
- Perfect for your first prototype

### **B. Transformer backbone (BEVFormer‑style)**
- More expressive
- More expensive
- Better for future fusion with camera transformers

**Start with CNN → later upgrade to transformer.**

---

## 4) **Fusion Transformer (FuTr / AdapterFusion)**
This is where your multi‑modal magic happens.

You take:

- LiDAR BEV features
- Camera features (later)
- Optional task‑specific adapters

And fuse them using:

- Cross‑attention
- Token‑to‑token fusion
- AdapterFusion (modality‑specific adapters + shared backbone)
- FuTr‑style BEV queries attending to LiDAR + camera features

This stage sits **after** the LiDAR backbone, not before.

---

# 🧩 So the correct order is:

```
Raw LiDAR → Voxelizer/Pillarizer → PFN → BEV Backbone → Transformer Fusion → Task Heads
```

And for multi‑task:

```
Transformer Fusion Output
   ├── 3D Detection Head
   ├── Drivable Area Segmentation Head
   └── (future) Depth / Occupancy / Motion Heads
```

This is exactly how modern multi‑modal systems are structured.

# 🧠 Why you *must* have a LiDAR encoder before the transformer

Transformers expect:

- tokens
- embeddings
- positional encodings
- structured feature maps

Raw point clouds are:

- unordered
- irregular
- variable‑length
- sparse

So you need the voxelizer + PFN + backbone to produce a **dense BEV representation** that transformers can operate on.

FuTr, BEVFormer, and AdapterFusion all assume you already have:

- BEV tokens
- camera tokens
- positional encodings

before fusion.

# 🛠️ A tiny LiDAR encoder that fits your RTX 2050

Here’s a minimal configuration that will run smoothly:

### **Voxelizer**
- Pillar size: 0.32m × 0.32m
- Max points per pillar: 20
- Max pillars: 12k

### **PFN**
- 64‑dim MLP
- Max‑pool across points

### **BEV Backbone**
- 3–4 CNN blocks
- Channels: 64 → 128 → 128
- Output BEV: 200×200×128 (fits in memory)

### **Fusion Transformer (later)**
- 2–4 layers
- 4 heads
- 128‑dim tokens

This is small enough to train on your laptop.

# 🧭 Recommended development order

Since you’re building a multi‑modal multi‑task system, here’s the cleanest path:

### **Phase 1 — LiDAR‑only**
- Implement voxelizer
- Implement PFN
- Implement BEV CNN backbone
- Implement 3D detection head
- Train on A2D2 or Argoverse2
- Validate pipeline

### **Phase 2 — Add drivable area**
- Add segmentation head
- Add multi‑task loss balancing
- Validate multi‑task behavior

### **Phase 3 — Add transformer fusion**
- Add BEV transformer
- Add camera encoder
- Add cross‑attention
- Add adapters (AdapterFusion)
- Train multi‑modal multi‑task model

This gives you a smooth learning curve.
