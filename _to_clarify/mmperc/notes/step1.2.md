Perfect — this is exactly the right moment to drop in a **tiny, GPU‑friendly BEV backbone** that sits cleanly after your PFN and before any transformer or multi‑task heads.

What you want here is:

- **small enough** to run on your RTX 2050  
- **modular enough** to plug into FuTr or AdapterFusion later  
- **BEV‑native** (2D CNN over H×W)  
- **simple** (no fancy FPN, no multi‑scale yet)  
- **fast** (so you can iterate quickly)  

Let’s build a backbone that mirrors the *spirit* of PointPillars but is much lighter.

# 🧱 Design goals for your tiny BEV backbone

### ✔️ Input  
A BEV feature map from PFN, shape:

```
(B, C_in, H, W)
```

### ✔️ Output  
A richer BEV feature map:

```
(B, C_out, H/2, W/2)
```

This downsampling is important because:

- it reduces memory  
- it increases receptive field  
- it prepares tokens for transformers later  

### ✔️ Architecture  
A simple 3‑stage CNN:

1. **Stem**: 1×1 conv to normalize channels  
2. **Block 1**: 3×3 conv → BN → ReLU  
3. **Block 2**: 3×3 conv → BN → ReLU  
4. **Downsample**: stride‑2 conv  
5. **Block 3**: 3×3 conv → BN → ReLU  

This is tiny but expressive enough for early experiments.

# 🧠 Why this backbone is ideal for your prototype

### 🟩 1. **Small enough for RTX 2050**
- ~0.5M parameters  
- Very low memory footprint  
- Fast even with batch size 1  

### 🟩 2. **BEV‑native**
It operates purely in the BEV plane, which is exactly what you want before:

- 3D detection heads  
- Drivable area segmentation  
- BEV transformers  
- FuTr fusion  

### 🟩 3. **Transformer‑ready**
The output `(B, C_out, H/2, W/2)` can be reshaped into tokens:

```
tokens = bev.flatten(2).transpose(1, 2)   # (B, HW, C)
```

Perfect for cross‑attention.

### 🟩 4. **Easy to scale**
When you move to a 40GB GPU later, you can:

- add more blocks  
- add multi‑scale features  
- add FPN  
- add deformable attention  
- replace CNN with a BEV transformer  

The interface stays the same.

# 🧪 Quick test snippet

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = TinyBEVBackbone(in_channels=64).cuda()
    x = torch.randn(1, 64, 200, 200).cuda()
    y = model(x)
    print(y.shape)  # expected: (1, 128, 100, 100)
```

# 🧭 Next step options

You can choose what to build next:

### **A. PFN (Pillar Feature Network)**  
To generate the BEV input for this backbone.

### **B. Multi‑task heads**  
- 3D detection  
- Drivable area segmentation  

### **C. BEV → transformer tokenization**  
Preparing for FuTr or AdapterFusion.

### **D. Camera encoder**  
For later fusion.

### **E. FuTr‑style fusion block**  
Cross‑attention between BEV tokens and camera tokens.

Just tell me which direction you want to go.
