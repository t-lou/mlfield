# **mlfield**

My private playground and notes collection for ML.

---

## 🚀 **Overview**

**mlfield** is a modular repository designed for:

- Fast iteration on ML experiments
- Clean separation of ideas into themed subfolders
- Reproducible development environments
- Notes, insights, and research logs that accompany experiments
- Future expansion into multimodal, SSL, and robotics‑related workflows

It’s intentionally lightweight and flexible — a “field notebook” for machine learning.

## 📁 **Repository Structure**

```
mlfield/
│
├── .devcontainer/      # Reproducible development environment (incl. VS Code devcontainer, direct init not supported)
│
├── components/         # Reusable layers, functions and models
│
├── experiments/        # The trainings and evaluations
│
├── notes/              # General research notes, logs, design sketches, and conceptual writeups
│
├── tools/              # Standalone utilities for editing checkpoints, for controlling WSL2 etc
│
├── _to_clarify/        # Legacy before restructering, which needs to be deleted or continued
│
└── (more coming...)
```

Each folder is self‑contained and may include scripts, notebooks, configs, and experiment logs.

## 🛠️ **Getting Started**

### **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/t-lou/mlfield
bash mlfield/.devcontainer/launch.sh
```

After creation with bash, optionally reopen the folder with VS Code inside a container. Please reopen only, rebuilding will break.

### 📁 Optional Dataset Mount (`DATASET_DIR` via `local.env`)

You can mount a local dataset into the container by defining `DATASET_DIR` in your `.devcontainer/local.env` file:

```
DATASET_DIR=/path/to/your/dataset
```

The compose file uses:

```
- ${DATASET_DIR:-/dev/null}:/mnt/dataset:ro
```

If `DATASET_DIR` is set in `.devcontainer/local.env`, that directory is mounted read‑only at `/mnt/dataset`.
If it’s missing, the mount safely falls back to `/dev/null`.
